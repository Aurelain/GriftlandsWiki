If the player has one or more [[Haggle Badge]] boon, the player can haggle for additional quest reward when accepting side quests. talk to the quest giver, and you will enter a special negotiation with the giver.

In this negotiation, the opponent has 10 base [[Resolve]], and creates '''Bonus''' bounties. It has "When destroyed, add [[Shills]] equal to the current stacks to your bonus. Reduce by 25% at end of your turn. When destroyed, the owner gains 1 impatience. <span style="color:red">If you lose the negotiation, you lose all bonuses!</span>". A small bonus bounty(25%~50% original quest reward, low resolve) is always created, and a large bonus bounty(50%~150% original quest reward, maximum 99, high resolve) is created for each [[Haggle Badge]] the player has.

By default, the player gain a 10-[[Shills|Shill]] bonus if they win the negotiation, but the reward will increase if the player destroyed one or more bonus bounties.

The bonus is added to the quest reward, so the player still has to complete the quest in order to gain the reward from this negotiation.
