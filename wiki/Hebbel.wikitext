'''Hebbel''' is the proprietor of [[The Last Stand]] in [[Grout Bog]]. He prides himself on his family business and its independence from the '''Spark Barons'''. Hebbel acts as an informant for special clientele, passing along messages and delivering packages to clients.

== Services ==

*Hebbel offers a random set of 3 [[Card#Item Cards|items]] to purchase that changes each day. 
*Like Fssh, he sells food and alcohol that restores HP and Resolve, respectively.
*Talking to Hebbel allows the player to access Rook's room where [[Rook#Outfits|outfits]] can be changed and pets can be interacted with if owned.
*If spoken with at the end of the night, the player can choose to sleep in their room which advances the story.

== Trivia ==

Hebbel, curiously, is assigned to The Spree faction unlike all other merchants present in the game. A particular quest has Rook turning over proof of an assassinated target to Hebbel, with Hebbel seemingly acknowledging the proof, hinting towards his more secretive dealings with Rook's shadow client.
