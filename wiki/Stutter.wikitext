Stutter is a basic negotiation [[Bog Parasites|Bog-Parasite]] card for [[Rook]]. It costs 1 action and has the effect: "Play your next card twice. Gain 2 Vulnerability and lose 4 resolve. Unplayable, Parasite, Hatch"

Stutter is obtained by hatching an uncommon negotiation parasite card.

==Hatch==
When Stutter hatches, it transforms into the only unique negotiation parasite, [[Bog Enlightenment]].
