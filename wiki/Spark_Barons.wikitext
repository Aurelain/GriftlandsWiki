A faction consisting of technocrats who take and retrofit [[Vagrant Age]] technology for modern use, much to the [[Cult of Hesh|Cult's]] displeasure. The '''Spark Barons''' control most of [[Grout Bog]] and employ indentured servitude to excavate the ancient ruins found within. The Barons are extremely wealthy due to their control over Grout Bog and the selling of vast amounts of advanced weapons and technology excavated from the ruins found there.

'''Notable Barons:'''
*[[Arint]]
*[[Fellemo]]
*[[Kashio]]
*[[Plocka 'The Swab']]

== Negotiation Pattern ==
The Spark Barons Negotiate by continually taking the players cards hostage and gaining composure while dealing damage. Their patterns are relatively standard, however their appropriation ability can render many decks unplayable and force the player to focus down arguments instead of the core resolve.

=== Appropriation ===
Appropriation is the core argument of Spark Barons. Every turn starting from turn 2, Spark Barons will steal 2 cards from your deck and put them into Appropriated Arguments.

=== Appropriated ===
An Argument that is sent out every turn via the core argument. It's resolve is equal to (i need specifics, it may be difficulty or may be costs). Every time the Spark Baron takes their turn, they will steal 2 cards from the player at the end, unless that would bring the player to less than 5 cards in their hand. Destroying the argument will grant the player the hostage cards immediately into their current hand. This can be useful as to guarantee certain combos by letting certain cards be held hostage until you can pull off a strong combo.

== Trivia ==
* The symbol for the Spark Barons is a modified [[Shills]] symbol with a half-cog.
* The original name for the Spark Barons was ''Clust Tycoons''.
