==Notes==
'''Shel''' is the sole bearer of the Downtrodden Merchant Title. She appears to be a merchant who is doing poorly, and usually resorts to doing things way out of her league, such as attempting to rob Sal (a well-equipped and trained bounty hunter) as well as attempting to fight a [[Grawkit]].
