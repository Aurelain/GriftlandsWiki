'''Lumin''' is a biofuel, which is harvested from the ocean floor. The [[Cult of Hesh]] monopolized it and takes debtors in as workers to repay their debts. 

[[Sal]] had to work for the cult several years before she became a bounty hunter. She practically spent her childhood in lumin pipes.

== Properties ==
Lumin is a blue biofuel that is often used as fuel or for making weapons. It is mostly mined from the ocean, though it can be found in creatures, such as [[Krill]], as well. From organisms, it can be harvested from their corpses or excreted in fecal form.
