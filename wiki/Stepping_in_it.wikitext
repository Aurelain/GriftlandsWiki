[[File:Rook_story_stepping_in_it.png|15px]]'''Stepping in it''' is the story quest for Day 1 of [[Rook]]'s story, [[The Bog Job]].
== Entering Grout Bog ==
Upon reaching the gate to the city, Rook is stopped by a [[Spark Barons Taskmaster]]. To proceed inside, you have two choices:
* Pay 20 {{shills}}
* Win a <span style="color:BlueViolet">negotiation</span> (the guard will start with -6 resolve)


The guard will then ask who you are going to work for. This choice will include a faction card and makes meeting that faction leader easier. (Note: this choice does not prevent starting the quest with the other faction.)

* [[File:Rook story work for kalandra.png|20px]] Report to [[Kalandra]], a foreman and receive [[Shovel]]
