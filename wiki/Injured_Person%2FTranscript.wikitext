This is a transcript for the event [[Injured Person]].

== Initial State ==
 * {injured person} comes stumbling towards you, clutching {his/her} gut like it might fall out.
 injured person:
     Please! Help me!
 player:
     Hold on. What's happening?
 injured person:
     (If Admiralty)An admiralty patrol just attacked me! But I ain't done nothing wrong!
     (If Spree)Spree! They're tryin' to kill me! Please, there ain't no one else who can help!

=== Hide {injured person} until the danger passes ===
 player:
     Alright. Hide in the treeline and I'll keep them busy.
 injured person:
     Th-thank you! 
 * {injured person} hobbles {his/her} way to the tree line and gets out of sight just in time.

=== Agree to protect {injured person} ===
 player:
     (If Admiralty)Sounds like the Admiralty, all right. Get behind me.
     (If Spree)They're dogged like that. All right, get behind me.
 injured person:
     Th-thank you!
 * {injured person} wipes blood from their mouth and huddles in your shadow.

=== Leave {injured person} to his/her fate ===
 player:
     (If Admiralty)Admiralty? No offense, but I'd rather not get involved.
     (If Spree)Spree? Uh, I'd prefer to stay out of trouble.
 injured person:
     N-no! Please! You have to help me!
 player:
     Sorry, it's not my place.
 * With a panicked yelp, {injured person} makes for the treeline. Likely the only help {he/she}'ll get there will be from hungry yotes.

== Admiralty Arrive ==

=== Intro ===
 * Sure enough, the Admiralty patrol comes hot on {injured person}'s tail, breathless from the chase.
 attacker:
     Hey, you! We're looking for a wanted criminal. You seen 'em?

=== Give up {injured person} ===
 player:
     Actually, you know what? I have. {injured_person} is all yours.
 injured_person:
     You said you'd help me!
 player:
     I did. But that's before I knew you were a <i>wanted criminal</i>, so it doesn't count.
 attacker:
     Thank you for your help, citizen! This one's been a thorn in our sides too long.

=== Trick {attacker} into looking elsewhere ===
 player:
     Now that you mention it, I did see someone walk off towards the creek over there. 
 attacker:
     Hm, that's rough wood in that direction. Are you sure?

=== Fail negotiation ===
 player:
     Yep, {injured person} was definitely headed in that direction.
 attacker:
     I didn't say {his/her} name. 
 player:
     Oh. Uh... oops?
 attacker:
     So it's an accomplice, is it? You're under arrest!

=== Succeed negotiation ===
 player:
     Yeah, {he/she} looked real roughed up. I think {he/she} might've been concussed?
 attacker:
     Good—we'll catch {him/her} quick. Thanks for your help, grifter!
    !exit
 player:
     No problem, Officer Brine-for-Brains.
 * {injured person} emerges from the treeline, trembling like a beaten dog.
 injured person:
     Thank you—truly. Hesh must like me something fierce to put a hunter in my path.
 player:
     Hesh doesn't like you much if it lets you bleed out. Let's get you some help, huh?
 * You help {injured person} to walk as gingerly as you can, but leave a string of profanities in their wake.

=== Defend {injured person} after fail negotiation ===
 player:
     Yeah, that's right. An accomplice. So come and get me, switch scum!

=== Give up {injured person} after fail negotiation ===
 player:
     Hey now, I'm no accomplice⁠—I have nothing to do with this. {He/She} is hiding right over there.
 attacker:
     That's more like it. Get out of here before you get yourself hurt.

=== Intimidate {attacker} ===
 player:
     I'm a hunter, and I've just been contracted by {injured person} here to keep them alive.
     Even if it means killing ''you'' to guarantee it.

=== Fail intimidation ===
 player:
     So what's it gonna be, punk? Do you feel lucky?
 attacker:
     I do, actually. After all, I've got two suckers here instead of one.

=== Succeed intimidation ===
 player:
     So how do you wanna end this? Alive, or dead?
 attacker:
     ...
     Yeah? All {he/she} has is pocket lint anyway. Enjoy your ''contract'', hunter.
 * {attacker} leaves in a hurry, with a few cautionary glances over {his/her} shoulder.
 injured person:
     Thank you—truly. Hesh must like me something fierce to put a hunter in my path on today of all days.
 player:
     He doesn't like you much if he lets you bleed out. Let's get you some help, huh?
 * You help {injured person} to walk as gingerly as you can, but leave a string of profanities in their wake.

=== Attack {attacker} ===

     You're gonna pay for what you did!

=== Intro ===
 * The Spree are punctual, especially when there's a trail of blood to follow.
 attacker:
     Hey! You lookin' for trouble?

=== Give up {injured person} ===
 player:
     You know what? I'm really not. I'm a hunter. So how about I leave you to your business, and you leave me to mine?
 injured person:
     W-what?! N-no! You said you would help me!
 attacker:
     We don't want no trouble with a hunter. Sod off, and we'll take care of the rest.
 player:
     Ruder than I'd like, but fair.
 * You continue down the path, ignoring the screams you leave behind you.

=== Trick {attacker} into looking elsewhere ===
 player:
     Not me, friend. I'm just minding my own business.
     But now that you mention it, I ''did'' see a weeping wretch head off in the other direction.
     Easy pickings for you, I imagine.
 attacker:
     Is that so?

=== Fail negotiation ===
 player:
     Sure. They were limping and everything. Go that way, and you can't miss 'em.
 attacker:
     Funny, 'cause we just came from that direction, and I didn't see no wretch.
     You're up to something!

=== Succeed negotiation ===
 attacker:
     I was actually just thinking I should circle back and check again. Thanks for your help!
 player:
     No problem, scum.

     Thank you so much! You saved my life there.

     Let's get you somewhere safe.
