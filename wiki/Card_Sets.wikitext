Card Sets add extra cards to the game (meaning you can get them from card rewards), they can be unlocked by playing with the corresponding character.
Before starting a run, you can choose which of your unlocked Card Sets you want to enable, remember that disabling any set, will put the run into custom mode (meaning you can't unlock new [[Prestige]] levels).
Each character has 10 Card Sets and they always contain 3 Negotiation and Battle cards. 

Also some Card Sets add new [[Outfits]], these can then be used even if the Card Set is disabled.
