'''Introducing Smith Update''' was released on November 5, 2020<ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/123141-griftlands-introducing-smith/ Griftlands: Introducing Smith!] Posted on November 5, 2020.</ref>.

==Update Information==
This update adds a third playable story character: '''[[Smith]]'''!

Smith's story takes place on a unique map, with new locations, quests, and characters to interact with. Smith has his own negotiation and combat cards, and uses new exclusive mechanics.

'''Play The First Two Days'''

The first two days of Smith's story are currently playable. There are a lot of alternate quests to play in Smith's story, and you'd have to play through at least six times to see them all. Smith's final story will have 4 days, like Rook. You can unlock Smith by beating Rook's first day. You can unlock Smith's Brawl by reaching the end of his story as it exists now.

'''Run History!'''

We've also added a Run History screen, so you can look back at past victories and losses.

'''New NPCs''' and, as always, there have been a whole slew of general fixes and balance changes.

*Mods can specify a dependency order by specifying load_before/load_after tables. Thanks RageLeague!
*Default parasite hatch functions are exposed via Content.HatchNegotiationParasite and Content.HatchBattleParasite.
*Localize mod_option spinner value klname strings.
*Localize mod_option spinner value name strings.
*Better type-checking when priority sorting the mods table.
*Move ally images into their respective CharacterDefs for better extensibility.
*Default mod aliases to the mod ID if not specified, so that the paths in Content.PLAX_DATA are aliased.
*Clear Content.SORTED_PLAX_DATA when adding a new plax, so that it will be regenerated.
*Fix plax saving for mods; the installPaths are unaliased so the paths need to be handled differently than they were.
*Ensure new plaxes are associated with the same mod as the currently open plax by default (the combo box indicated as such, but the value wasn't being assigned if the combo box was left untouched).
*Morning mail is now a global event so that it can be intercepted by more than just grafts.
*Print errors loading local and dev mods into the log, in addition to showing the engine warning.
*wide strings are no longer considered 'plain' by serpent, and will get escaped and quoted when being serialized out by serpent.
