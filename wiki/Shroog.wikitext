'''Shroogs''' are apex predators of the Roaloch. Most Shroogs in Havaria are in their younger stages, and are called Shrooglets. They are often used as attack animals, and are good at it too. Shrooglets that live long enough grow into adult Shroogs, which, as possibly demonstrated in [[Sal|Sal's]] story, are extremely dangerous.

An adult Shroog can appear as a possible Boss in Sal's story, on Day 3, the other being the [[Drusks|Drusks]].
