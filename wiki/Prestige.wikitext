'''Prestige''' levels are toggle-able modifiers that increase the difficulty of the game. In return, players are rewarded an additional 10% XP per prestige activated. 
The final day must be completed with the current unlocked prestige level to unlock the next prestige level, and prestige effects stack with each other as more are unlocked and added. you can not unlock new prestige levels if custom mode is turned on. You have to unlock new levels separately with every character.
