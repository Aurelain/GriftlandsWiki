Each day in [[Griftlands]] is made up of a series of '''quests''', which involve some task or problem you must solve. Each quest has one or more [[combat]] or [[negotiation]] tasks, and often gives you some element of choice in how to complete these challenges.

== Quest Structure ==
When selecting a quest, each quest has a name, a short description, the quest's '''difficulty''' from one to five stars, the '''focus''', and a set of rewards. Quests can either be combat, negotiation, or combat and negotiation based, though the focus doesn't always dictate what you need to do.

In Sal's campaign, you often choose one quest between three different quest givers. In both campaigns, major characters will also give a quest or a choice between two of them.

While the dialogue and general structure of each individual quest is always the same, the characters involved are often random, or randomly selected from a certain faction or role.[[File:Griftlandsquestexample.png|0.5px|frame|center|An example quest header from Sal's campaign.]]

== Rewards ==
Quest rewards include [[shills]] based on the difficulty, and a randomly selected extra reward which is one of the following: bonus shills, upgrade a card, remove a card, restore either 20 health or 10 resolve, get an [[Items|item card]], or a choice between three [[grafts]] (for harder missions/some story missions). Neither of these rewards are given if you fail the quest.

Some quests in Sal's campaign may give an initial bonus of a card choice. Additionally, many missions can give additional rewards/consequences based on what actions you take, such as changing [[relationships]].
