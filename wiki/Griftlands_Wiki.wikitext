<!-- TO EDIT MAIN PAGE CONTENT, see "Templates used on this page" below and edit:
     * {{SITENAME}}/Top section
     * {{SITENAME}}/Flex section
     * {{SITENAME}}/Bottom section

     This is a basic responsive front page design that adapts to the available width of the browser by 
     rearranging the sections themselves as well as content within each section. When narrow, the three sections
     line up vertically in a single column. When wide enough, the middle (flex) section is pulled out to become a 
     right column.

     Much of the layout and appearance is determined through styles defined in these pages:
     * MediaWiki:Common.css (for the desktop view)
     * MediaWiki:Mobile.css (for the mobile view)
