'''Civilians''' are a faction found everywhere in Havaria. While they are, by definition, factionless, they aid each other in negotiations and in combat. Civilians can be found everywhere, in workplaces, in shops, and at bars.

Civilians have two classes: the wealthy and the poor. Civilians within the same wealth class will support each other in combat.

== Civilian Titles ==

=== High Class ===

==== Wealthy Merchant ====
Wealthy Merchants are rich people who earned their money through trading, debt-broking, and other profitable activities. They are most often found in shops or on the road. Wealthy Merchants' '''Negotiation''' strategy is not actually hard to beat. However, they can easily drain you of your shills due to their Core Argument, which place cards in your deck that cost money to play, and also take up valuable space for other cards. In '''Combat''' , Wealthy Merchants throw a variety of grenades and mixtures to provide a variety of status effects to the enemy team. An enemy-exclusive attack is the Oshnu Bile Grenade, which only targets the player. This gives the Oshnu Stinging Eyes debuff, causing the player to target a random opponent whenever they attack.

Foolo the Dilettante is mechanically similar to Wealthy Merchants.

==== Foreman ====
Foremen are people who overseer the work of Laborers and Heavy Laborers, ensuring that their work is kept at peak efficiency. They are usually located in workplaces, where they can command Laborers to do their job. The '''Negotiation''' strategy of the Foreman is to create several low-health arguments to slowly chip away at the player's Resolve. This is made harder by the fact that their Core Argument causes damage spilled-over from attacking their arguments to target the player instead. If forced to resort to '''Combat''', Foremen wield a simple pistol, which needs a reload whenever they attack a number of times. In between, Foremen can also attack with the blade on their pistol, albeit with weaker damage.

==== Bartender ====
Bartenders are merchants who sell food, drink, and sometimes drugs. Their usual location is, obviously, in bars. In negotiations, their Core Argument gets composure for each manipulation card you play. Periodically, they may get a "chaser" bounty which restores some resolve if you destroy it, at the cost of putting tipsy cards in your deck. In combat, they use a powerful shotgun attack which hits all opponents, but requires reloading between attacks. 

=== Low Class ===

==== Laborer ====
Laborers are poor people who work to earn money, or are forced to do it for free. They are usually found in shops and workplaces, working for whoever's in charge. In a '''Negotiation''', the Laborer's Core Argument gives it 2 Composure every time the player creates an argument. In '''Combat''', Laborers use a pipe to Whack enemies, slowly buffing themselves with more power over time.

==== Promoted Laborer ====

==== Heavy Laborer ====
