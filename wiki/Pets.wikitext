'''Pets''' are animals that can be kept as allies. '''Pets''' can be upgraded through '''training''' by speaking with Phroluk. Just like hostile wild animals, pets will flee rather than panic and surrender once enough damage is done to them. '''Pets''' are unique from other types of allies in that they also have an effect on negotiations depending on the species. Pets can be stored at your room in the inn if their health drops too low and they regain all health when rested just like the Hero.

'''Crayotes''', or '''Yotes''' for short, can be found all across Havaria. A strange cross between a canine and insect, they have a canine-like appearance but grow a hard carapace and six limbs.
