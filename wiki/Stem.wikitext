Stem is a basic negotiation [[Bog Parasites|Bog-Parasite]] card for [[Rook]]. It has the effect: "When this card is drawn, increase the cost of a random card in your hand until the end of this turn. Unplayable. Parasite. Hatch."

Stem is obtained, together with [[Twig]], at the start of day 2, as Rook.
