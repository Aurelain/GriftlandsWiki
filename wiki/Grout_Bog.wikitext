Grout Bog is a swampy, creature infested region of Havaria governed and owned by the [[Spark Barons]]. 

== Geography ==

=== Terrain ===
The bog is mostly uninhabitable, infested with dangerous insects and creatures. The West side of the bog is home to the Spark Baron regional headquarters and laborer housing. Nearby is the Last Stand, owned by Hebbel, a bar and the region's "last independently owned establishment". It is used as a safe-house by Rook during his stay in the bog. The bog is home to several factions, but the Spark Barons own the land and control the labor. Notably missing from the bog compared to Murder Bay is the Admiralty. While the Spark Barons and most sane beings live on the West side of the bog, the Southeast region is occupied by [[Boggers|some]] who claim to hear the bog speak, and the bog is telling them it wants to consume...
