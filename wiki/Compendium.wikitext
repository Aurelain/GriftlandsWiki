'''The Compendium''' is an in-game menu that allows a player to view and explore unlocked cards, people, [[Grafts]] and [[Grifts]].

== Cards ==
In this section you can look at all of your unlocked cards, so all cards that are in the basic cardpool, are included in your unlocked [[Card Sets]], obtain trough special events/bought or are given to you by enemies. Just like in-game, you can right-click them to see their flavor text and upgrades. 

== People ==
In this section you can look at every person you have met. By clicking on them you can see their flavor text, listen to their voice and see their Boon/Bane, if you have gotten it once.

== Grafts ==
In this section you can look at every Graft you've seen, it also tells you if you have installed it.

== Grifts ==
In this section you can see every Grift and your progress in them.
