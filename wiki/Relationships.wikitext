'''Relationships''' are a secondary mechanic in Griftlands that has varying effects on negotiations and battle. Depending on the relationship with an NPC, some quests may go from being a shakedown to being an all out brawl, or may make an otherwise challenging intimidation attempt trivial. Some [[Mutators]] can be applied to a run that drastically change how relationships work. Ex. Random relationship upon meeting a character.

==Relationship Stages==
Relationships with NPC's come in 5 stages. By default, most NPC's will be '''Neutral''' towards the player.

*'''Hated''' — occurs randomly when [[murdering]] characters that are not isolated, or from some quest results (betraying/capturing some characters). NPC's that hate the player give a class-specific Bane, heckles in nearby negotiation, join battles against the player if present, and always target the player in battle. [[Kashio]] hates [[Sal]] by default, though no accompanying Bane is applied. +20 core [[Resolve]].
*'''Disliked''' — characters who are attacked, intimidated, or are the victim of a shakedown will dislike the player and heckle in nearby negotiations. +10 core [[Resolve]].
*'''Neutral/Not Met''' — no effect on the player.
*'''Liked''' — characters helped by doing work for them or who are bought drinks at a bar will like the player, and will provide support in nearby negotiation. -10 core [[Resolve]] (minimum 1).
*'''Loved'''— characters who like the player, if [[Gifting|gifted]], will love the player and provide a random class specific Boon to the player, as well as assist in combat/negotiation. -20 core [[Resolve]] (minimum 1).

==Banes and Boons==
Being '''Hated''' or '''Loved''' provides a Bane or Boon to the player that provides a bonus depending on the character class. Each character in the game belongs to a faction and has a profession that determines what Bane or Boon they provide.
