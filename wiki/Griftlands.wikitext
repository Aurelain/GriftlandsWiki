[[Griftlands]] is a game created by [[Klei]], where everything is negotiable: money, loyaltyâ€”even morality. Choose your character and make your fortune. Griftlands was announced in 2015 as a new RPG, but the developers rebooted the project and turned Griftlands into a single-player deck building game. The alpha started exclusively on the EPIC game store first and costs $14.99.

* '''Fall:''' Character 2 campaign (days 1 through ?) is released
