The Hesh Outpost is a secret location in Murder Bay managed by two [[Cult of Hesh|Heshians]]: Murkot, a Shroke [[Luminari]], and Phrylotas, a [[Kra'deshi]] Priest. The outpost can be unlocked in [[Sal|Sal's]] run after aiding Murkot in carrying Spark to the Outpost, and convinving Phrylotas that you will not reveal the outpost's location.

== Services ==

Once a day, Sal can either ask Murkot for a sparring session or get a blessing from Phrylotas.

*Sparring with Murkot will cause Sal to lose 5 Health and distribute 5 XP to the Battle Deck.

*Asking Phrylotas to bless Sal will restore 15 Resolve.
