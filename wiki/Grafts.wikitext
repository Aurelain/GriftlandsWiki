'''Grafts''' are items that can be collected by the player that have a range of positive effects. Each Hero is able to install a limited amount of grafts. Grafts come in two varieties, <span style="color:#ff9a5a">'''Battle Grafts'''</span> and <span style="color:#9c8eff">'''Negotiation Grafts'''</span>, and each come in four different grades of rarity: <span style="color:#ffffff">'''Common'''</span>, <span style="color:#c6efff">'''Uncommon'''</span>, <span style="color:#fff35a">'''Rare'''</span>, <span style="color:#ef82ce">'''Boss'''</span> and <span style="color:#ef82ce">'''Unique'''</span>.

Common, uncommon, and rare grafts can be bought from Plocka. [[Plocka 'The Swab']] also sells additional graft slots for shills, but this also damages the Hero's current health. Unique grafts are available only in [[Brawl mode]] from the start.
