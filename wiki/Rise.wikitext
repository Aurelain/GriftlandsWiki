{{Quote|When the time comes... I hope you remember who really believes in you.|Kalandra}}

'''The Rise''' are a "loose group of union organizers and freedom fighters campaigning for workers' rights across [[Havaria]]." Most Rise members are found in [[Grout Bog]], serving as laborers for the [[Spark Barons]] excavating the ruins found beneath the bog. Some '''Rise''' members can be found in Murder Bay as well, spreading propaganda among the [[Jakes]]. Many of the '''Rise''' are severely in debt and are too poor to even eat daily meals.  

'''Notable members:'''
*'''Fallons (Sal's mother and father; deceased)'''
*[[Flekfis]]
*[[Prindo Kalandra]]
