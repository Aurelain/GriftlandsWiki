'''Difficulty''' is a mechanic in Griftlands. It affects how difficult non-boss characters are to negotiate with or fight against, affect the quest rewards, determine what characters can be casted into a quest, and what characters are generated as a patrol team or backup. It increases over time as the player progresses, though challenging side quests can temporarily increase the difficulty currently by 1.

Below is a table of difficulties for each campaign.
