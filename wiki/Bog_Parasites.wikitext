The Bog Parasites are [[Twig]], [[Stem]] and the cards they turn into, they are first obtained on day 2 as [[Rook]]. Everytime one of the Bog Parasites levels up it transforms into a random Bog Parasite 1 rarity higher, that also corresponds to the same deck-type, until reaching unique, where they cannot be upgraded anymore. 
The rarities all have a different level of "usefulness":

* basic: Negative effect
* common, uncommon and rare: Positive effect, with a drawback (Get stronger the higher the rarity)
* unique: Positive effect
