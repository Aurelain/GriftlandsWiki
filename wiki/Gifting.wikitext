Gifting is an action you can take. Whenever the player talks to another sentient character that likes you, and does not have [[Plot Armor]], the player have the option to gift that character some amount of money. This will cause that character to love you, and grant whatever [[Social Boon]] they have to you.

The amount of money required is determined by the following formula:

Cost = 50 Ã— max (2, [[Renown(NPC stat)|Renown]], [[Combat Strength]]).
