Events are random encounters that happen on the overworld map in specific times of a run. They often have multiple elements of choice that drastically change the outcome of the encounter and can even be game changing in some situations.


== Event Randomization ==

While at first these encounters may seem random they actually only occur at specific points of a run, these times can also vary slightly from run to run but remain consistent throughout all runs. All events are picked randomly from a the list of events assigned to that grifter and will scale in difficulty to match the current day the run is on however the rewards never scale and will stay the same through the entire run.
