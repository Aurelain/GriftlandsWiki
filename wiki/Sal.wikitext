{{quote|A bounty hunter with a chip on her shoulder and a glint in her eye, Sal escapes a life of servitude to claim the ultimate bountyâ€”and get her revenge.|Sal's Compendium Description}}

'''Sal Fallon''' (aka "[[Ik-Derrick]]") is a player character in {{Gamename}}. She is featured as a bounty hunter, who returns after ten years to the crime-ridden continent named [[Havaria]]. She once was sold into [[Derrick]] servitude by the criminal debt-broker [[Kashio]] and had to work as a slave. Sal is charismatic and bold, but a bit impatient. She utilizes twin daggers in combat.

== Background ==

As a child Sal grew up on Havaria, an only child to two laborers. Sal's parents were the leaders of the region's Rise movement, and thus Sal would frequently find herself under the care of [[Fssh]], Bounty Hunter and close friend to Sal's parents. Fssh spends time between her hunts with Sal as a mentor training her to fight. Eventually, Sal catches the eye of former laborer turned Spark Baron, [[Kashio]], and ends up under her care to be trained as a Bounty Hunter. However, Kashio eventually discovers a rare cache of Vagrant tech and suddenly finds herself in a highly influential position as a Spark Baron. This eventually leads to her becoming enemies with Sal's parents, and she betrays the family, murdering Sal's parents and selling Sal to the Lumin Derricks as a slave. Sal, stripped from her home and family, spends nearly a decade working off her slave debt through bribery and manipulation. She seeks out Fssh, who has since retired from being a Bounty Hunter and has opened a successful, if not dubious establishment in [[Murder Bay]] to seek help in confronting Kashio, who has since become the region's most powerful arms dealer and debt-broker. Sal now hunts Kashio to exact revenge and to collect the hefty bounty on her head.

== Hunting Kashio ==
In Sal's story, she returns after gaining her freedom through bounty hunting. Her first stop back in Havaria is the Grog n' Dog, in Murder Bay. There, she reunites with Fssh, her old mentor.
== Combat ==

Sal fights tooth and nail alongside her trusty dual daggers. Her unique deck mechanics are called '''Combo''' and '''Finisher''' and involves playing cards sequentially in order to build combo, then spending some or all of it with a finisher for large payouts in damage. Most of her other cards revolve around bleed and counter, favoring either an aggressive combo deck or defensive deck where statuses and counter attacks are stacked against enemies.

Her starting deck consists of the following cards:
*1x [[Sal's Daggers]]
*4x [[Feint]]
*3x [[Stab]]
*2x [[Elbow Strike]]
*1x [[Fight Dirty]]

== Negotiations ==

Sal's negotiations revolve around building large amounts of '''Influence''' or '''Dominance''' in order to boost her Diplomacy and Hostility cards. Sal's core argument gains +1 composure at the start of every turn, and her Manipulation cards have decent amounts of composure allowing her to stall negotiations fairly well until her damage can be built up.

Her starting deck consists of the following cards:

* 1x [[Sal's Instincts]]
*3x [[Deflection]]
*3x [[Fast Talk]]
*2x [[Threaten]]
*1x [[Quick Thinking]]

=== Sal's Savvy ===
'''Sal's Savvy''' is Sal's core argument. It has "At the beginning of each turn, gain 1 [[Composure]]".

== NPC Encounters ==
Sal can be found in Rook and Smith's stories through random encounters.

=== Rook ===
If playing as Rook, Sal will approach the player in Grout Bog for help tracking down a target from Murder Bay (a Spark Baron enforcer, Sparky or Jeol). The player can ask Sal questions about her background, in which she will playfully jab at Rook's old age, mention that she's afraid of reliving childhood trauma in the Bog, and reveal that she successfully killed Kashio, implying that ''"The Bog Job"'' takes place after ''"Hunting Kashio"''.

'''<u>Agree to the deal</u>'''

* If the player follows through and helps Sal fight the Spark Baron, Sal will love you regardless of whether you accept her money, granting the player her 'People Person' boon.
* If the player refuses to take Sal's money as payment, Sal will offer Rook one of her cards instead, telling him "maybe one day you can be as tough as me".

'''<u>Agree to the deal but betray Sal/side with the Spark Baron</u>'''

* Sal will hate the player and angrily call Rook's mustache a rat tail before engaging in battle.

=== Smith ===
If playing as Smith, Sal will warily approach the player in Pearl-On-The-Foam with the intent to kill Smith. Sal will always have an upgraded pet in her party.

'''<u>Defend yourself (Fight Sal)</u>'''

* If Sal is spared, she will reveal that she was hired by Vixmalli to assassinate Smith. She describes Vix as "the Heshy one with the money".
* If Sal is killed and her pet fled during battle, the pet will return to the scene and nuzzle Sal's corpse before becoming docile to Smith. The player will then have the option to leave the pet alone or take it along.

'''<u>Convince Sal not to attack you (Negotiate with Sal)</u>'''

* Sal will reveal that despite her distaste for Vixmalli, she took the job to earn enough money to return to Murder Bay. She mentions that she has personal business there and that Smith "isn't the only one with messed up family stuff to work out", implying that the events of ''"Hunting Kashio"'' take place after ''"The Inheritance"''.
* Sal can be paid by Smith to lie to Vixmalli, telling him that she chased Smith out of town. She will then love the player and grant you her boon.
* Sal is more serious and lacks the cheeky quips she usually says in her main campaign. It can be assumed that she was fresh off the derricks when she meets Smith.

== Trivia ==

* If Sal rescues a wild [[Yote]] before meeting Phroluk, she'll mention she's a "Crayote" person.
* Fssh tells Sal she needs to re-teach her how to throw a punch after seeing her fight [[Sparky]] or [[Jeol]] and she'll hurt herself if she doesn't change her form. This interaction elaborates on Sal's training with Fssh as a child and is likely referring to [[Over Extension]].
*Sal's Daggers are called Dag and Gurr, respectively. This is found on her Sal's Daggers card and its upgrade, Sal's Combo Daggers.
**"This one's called Dag. The other one's called Gurr. Yeah? Well I don't like '''your''' name either, pal."
*Sal was friends with [[Prindo Kalandra]] in their childhood, and evidently still cares for her despite the passing of time.
**''That night you dream you're a kid again, with the mud up to your armpits and your friend Prindo laughing at you.'' (Bedtime quip)
**"Hold it. Whatever you're involved with, don't say anything that might get [[Prindo Kalandra|her]] in trouble." (Conversation with a Rise Rebel in the quest Rise and Shine)
*Being the grifter who can use the battle card '[[Ravenous]]', Sal is not above cannibalism.
