In {{gamename}}, '''Characters''' can be met while playing through the selected Hero's story. Most characters you meet have random locations that change between runs, meaning you won't always get the same quest from the same NPC. Story central NPC's such as Fssh and Kashio, however, do not change between runs, though your dialogue with them will change depending on choices made throughout the run. Each character has a [[relationships|relationship]] with the player that changes depending on your choices, potentially granting useful [[Relationships#Banes and Boons|Boons or harmful Banes]].

== Playable Characters ==

Each Hero has their own set of stats and unique mechanics. Sal is the starting Hero, with Rook and Smith becoming available to play after advancing through Sal's story.

== Plot Armor ==
Some NPCs have plot armor. Having a plot armor means:

* Will not be assigned as generic cast in a quest, unless the quest explicitly requires that character.
* Will not spawn as patrons unless otherwise specified.
* Will not join combat with the player unless specifically encountered.
* Cannot be [[Gifting|Gifted]] or [[Provoking|Provoked]].
* Will not be affected by [[Mutators|First Impressions]].
* This character will never hate you because you killed someone in their faction.

Characters with plot armor can still die, unlike characters with [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor Plot Armor] in movies, TV shows, or other games.

Usually, characters with significant story relevance have plot armor. Many night merchants in [[Sal]]'s story also have plot armor.

Sometimes, the plot armor is conditional. For example, [[Oolo]] has plot armor in Sal's main story, [[Hunting Kashio]], while she doesn't have plot armor in Rook's story(although she will never spawn) or in [[Brawl]].
