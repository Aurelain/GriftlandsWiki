'''Dockhand''' is a [[Jakes]] Title. Dockhands aid with the loading and unloading of ships in a port, and since they're Jakes, might also unload some illegal items for themselves as well.

==Combat==
In Combat, Dockhands are slippery targets that focus on weakening enemies rather than dealing brute damage. They start with the '''Cruelty''' Condition, which apply 2 Wound if not defended.

'''Moves:'''

*Slippery: Applies 2 Stacks of Evade, which nullify two attacks against them for one turn. While attacks with damage will not take effect, pure debuff cards can.

|Despite her name, Brash is actually pretty level-headed.

|Gree
|Creepily enough, Gree has a reputation for singing her assassins contracts to their death.

|Juke
|Juke's a bit of a newcomer on the Havarian smuggling scene, but she makes up for it by charging a ruthless fee.

|Minfen
|You've heard Minfen used to be an indebted worker. Most aren't lucky enough to make it out.

|Pozgo
|"Pozgo" was the legendary ruler of a long-forgotten planet. You wonder if ''this'' Pozgo lived up to his parent's expectations.

|Cwoki

|You've heard that Cwoki has a collection of trading cards depicting the upper echelon of the Hesian cult—from cardinals to archbishops.

Of course, that's the Deltrean side. Unlikely Havarian clergy warrant any mention.

|You'd bet your last shill that Krog knows his way around his own sleeve—preferably, though, you wouldn't bet against Krog.

|Grunjax has a breath so rancid you can smell it after he's left the room. But he sure does have a nice smile.

|Queek
|Not all jakes do things by the book, but Queek's reputation, at least, is queeky clean.

|Tlok
|Most jarackles struggle to get the respect they deserve, so it says a lot that folks speak Tlok's name like he's one to watch out for.

|Apparently Ronno lost her hearing in her right earnub after a swamp gas explosion. Fortunately she hears extra-well out of the left one.
