__NOTOC__
This is a list of wiki administrators, both the Gamepedia staff members and the community-based administrators, listed on [[Project:Community portal]]. It takes one optional parameter:
: <code>width</code> &ndash; which specifies the width of the list

{{tlx|Wiki admin}} is used in this template to format admin entries.

==Usage==
:{{tlx|Admins|width}}

==Modifying the list==
Editing the source of this template will show commented-out examples of how to change the list. Gamepedia staff creating the wiki should remove the line about emailing and uncomment the {{Tlx|Wiki admin|Game Widow}} in that section and replace Game Widow with their own name.

Community admins can be added by following the commented-out example in that section.

If the wiki has a developer as an administrator, uncomment the Developer Administrators section and use {{Tlx|Wiki admin}} with their name, like in the community section.

==Example==
<div class="feature" style="border: 1px solid #505050; border-radius: 4px; margin: 5px; padding: 5px;">

:{{tlx|Admins|width{{=}}300px}}

'''Result:'''

{{Admins|width=300px}}

</div>
