==Notes==
*If the <code>name</code> and/or <code>image</code> parameters are not specified, the infobox will use <code>pagename</code> as title and/or <code>pagename.png</code> as image.
*Infobox adds category [[:Category:All cards]], and a category from [[:Category:Cards by character]], [[:Category:Cards by category]], [[:Category:Cards by type]] and [[:Category:Cards by rarity]], depending on the specified parameters.
*The <code>character</code> parameter isn't displayed in the infobox, used only for adding corresponding category.
