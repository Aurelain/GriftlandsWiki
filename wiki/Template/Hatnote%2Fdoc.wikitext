Using {{tl|Hatnote|''text''}} formats text into the standard stylistic for a wiki hatnote. That produces a short note placed at the top of an article to provide disambiguation of closely related terms or summarise a topic, explaining its boundaries.

==Function==
This template is primarily used to add a correctly formatted ''hatnote'' to a page. Often, but not always, this is a ''disambiguation link'' at the top of article pages. It places an HTML <code>div-</code> / <code>div</code> block around the text entered as its only argument, which provides standardized formatting (contents are indented and italicized in most displays); it also isolates the contained code to make sure that it is interpreted correctly.

This template is also used as the "meta-template" for additional specialized disambiguation link templates.

The template does not automatically create links of any kind. Links and other desired formatting must be explicitly added, using normal wiki markup.
