== Roaloch and Load ==
This [[Quests|quest]] is on day 3 at night. <br/>
[[Fssh]] needs contraband materials to finish her security. [[Sal]] needs to go to the docks to get them. <br/>
Optionally, you can convince the bouncer or pay them 200 {{shills}}, to help you with this quest.

== Docks ==
At the docks is a quarantine in place and Sal is stopped by an Admiralty Patrol Leader. <br/>
You can talk your way though, bribe (100 {{shills}}) or fight them. 

== Deck of the Ship ==
A Jakes Smuggler and Admiralty Clerk are discussing the quarantine. <br/>
You can:
* negotiate a side deal just for you. The Smuggler will leave.
* offer to attack the Admiralty. Probably a fight?
* negotiate to end the quarantine (+30 resolve). The Clerk will leave.
* grab the package and run. Probably a fight?

== Boss ==
Then the reason for the quarantine reveals itself. The boss is either [[Shroog]] or [[Crimson Drusk]]. <br/>
The Jakes Smuggler or Admiralty Clerk who is left will help you.
