'''The Admiralty''' is the military force of the Deltrean Empire occupying parts of [[Havaria]], notably [[Murder Bay]]. Many of the '''Admiralty''' soldiers find their station in the Griftlands disdainful, and are not afraid to treat the people living there as such. Due to being isolated across the Heshian Sea from their homeland, there are little to no repercussions for harassing the citizens of Murder Bay. Many of the Admiralty act as thugs in uniform, enacting tolls, shakedowns, and beatings to people as they see fit. As such, their presence in Murder Bay is highly unpopular with its residents and their patrols and supply lines are frequently harassed by [[Spree|the Spree]].

== Negotiation Pattern ==

Admiralty negotiate through creating annoying arguments that the player has to constantly deal with, in addition to incepting '''Planted Evidence''' that the player has to protect. '''Planted Evidence''' can be extremely dangerous if unprotected, because of how much damage they deal to the player's core arguments, especially on high [[Difficulty]]. Their arguments, if not dealt with quickly, will drain the player's [[Resolve]], [[Shills]], and can fill up the player's draw pile with trash cards.
=== Abuse of Power ===

'''Abuse of Power''' is the core argument of all admiralty. It has "At the start of the character's turn, incept a '''Planted Evidence''' argument if one does not already exist". '''Planted Evidence''' is a bounty which has 1 Resolve, and has "When this argument is dismissed, deal x damage to the owner's core argument", where x is equal to twice the current [[Difficulty]].

=== Interrogate ===

Starting from the 1st turn, every 3 turns, the admiralty character will create an '''Interrogate''' argument. '''Interrogate''' is an argument which continuously deals damage to the player's argument. The Resolve and the damage range of this argument is determined by the current Difficulty level. '''Interrogate Plus''' also has "When this argument destroys another argument, restore 3 core Resolve."

If the [[Difficulty]] is 3 or higher, starting from the 1st turn, every 6 turns, an additional '''Interrogate''' will be created.

=== Paper Pusher ===

When negotiating with an Admiralty Clerk, every time they will create '''Interrogate''', a '''Paper Pusher''' argument can be created instead. It has higher resolve than '''Interrogate''', and has "Insert a [[Baffled]] card into the player's draw pile for each stacks at the beginning of the owner's turn.".

=== Frisk ===

Starting from the 2nd turn, every 3 turns, there is a 50% chance that this character will create a '''Frisk''' argument. It has "At the start of this player's turn, steal 10 [[Shills]] from the opponent and remove 1 '''Frisk'''". The amount of stacks created is equal to the current Difficulty. Only 1 '''Frisk''' argument can be created throughout a negotiation.

=== Damage ===

Admiralty will attack twice every 3 turns, starting from the 3rd turn. Otherwise the character will attack once.

=== Composure ===

Starting from the 2nd turn, every 3 turns, if no '''Frisk''' argument will be created, composure will be applied instead. The amount applied is equal to 1 + the current Difficulty.
