=== Overview ===
'''Murder Bay''' is one of the main locations in [[Griftlands]] and is where Sal's story takes place. It was initially shown in the first screenshots from the announcement of the game. Murder Bay encompasses a small portion of the North coast and serves as the main trading port between Havaria, Rentoria, and the Deltrean Empire. Home to [[Spree|murderous bandits]], [[Spark Barons|arms dealers]], and [[Cult of Hesh|cultists]] seeking treasures of the land, Murder Bay feels just like home. The Deltrean Admiralty has recently been deployed to the region in an attempt to bring law to the coast, but the corruption within their ranks says otherwise.
