'''Alongwy''' also works part-time as a bounty hunter.

In a random event, [[Sal]] can run into '''Alongwy''' in the wilderness trying to arrest a [[Spree]] member with a warrant. She can either agree to work with '''Alongwy''' and capture the member, or you can help the Spree member and fight '''Alongwy'''.
