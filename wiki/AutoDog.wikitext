'''AutoDogs''' are mechanical quadrupeds invented by the [[Spark Barons]] to serve as combat support drones, based off of the Automech. The [[Rise]] made some themselves, and call them '''Cobbledogs'''. Some AutoDogs can malfunction, and go feral, running into the wilderness of the bog and making a den. Like Crayotes, they are fairly weak individually but can be threatening when in packs.
